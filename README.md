# 🐍 Gesture-Controlled Snake Game

Control a classic Snake game using only your hand gestures via a webcam!  
This project combines **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **TensorFlow** to detect directional hand gestures and steer the snake in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Real-time Snake game controlled by hand gestures  
- 🤚 Uses **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection  
- 🧠 Trained with a custom neural network to classify gestures  
- 📷 Includes a tool for collecting your own gesture data  
- 📊 Visualizes training history and accuracy
